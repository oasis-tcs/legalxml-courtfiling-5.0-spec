	This xml example is from a series of examples that illustrate a full life cycle sequence use case for a illustration of  
	Barabara Holmes' Test Case # 1300 (Case Initiation, Court of Appeal, Appeal of an Agency determination). In this use case, 
	an attorney for the petitioner is appealing a decision from an executive branch agency (i.e. the Corporation Commission) to 
	an intermediary appellate court. 

	This example message is synchronously returned to the FAMDE by the FRMDE upon receipt of appellate-NOA-001-ReviewFilingRequest-00.xml.
